# Observe a offline wallet with Pawket on the go

So you created a [Chia Cold Wallet](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/Chia-Keys-Management#2-keys-farming-key--cold-storage-key) where you send your bought Chia and Farmin Rewards to. You want to be able to conveniently monitor your cold wallet.
Do it by importing your PUBLIC Key into Pawket.

## Start your offline wallet 

- For example you could create a [bootable Linux USB from Windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview) or [from Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview). I like more the [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/) Flavour, but process for creating the bootable USB stays the same.
- Put the [Official Chia Client](https://www.chia.net/downloads/) as additional file on your bootable stick (its FAT32 so you can access it from windows or from linux)
- Boot from this USB Stick without any Network connection
- When in Ubuntu Setup choose "Try Ubuntu"
- Ubuntu starts directly to desktop
- We now can temporarily install a Chia wallet. All what we do is deleted when we reboot / shutdown the computer
- Open a Terminal (Terminal / Konsole)
