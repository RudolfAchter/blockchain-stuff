# Chia Wallets

- [Chia Official Wallet](https://www.chia.net/download/)
- [Ozone Chia Mobile Wallet](https://ozonewallet.io/) : Ozone Wallet looks promising for Mobile Clients. But there is no support for NFT and DID / Chia Profiles already. Wallet seems to be the same Tech like Chia Light Wallet. The wallet is created on your device. So it's self custody.
- [Nucle.io Chia Modile Wallet](https://nucle.io/) : Nucle.io can Transfer Chia and one CAT Token. Buto also no NFT and DID Support. It's self custody. Wallet is directly on you device not relying on a Cloud Service
- [SkyNFT](https://skynft.org/nft_my_nft.php) : At Sky NFT you can have a Custodian Wallet. Wallet is managed by SkyNFT. It's mainly for Minting and Trading your NFTs on SkyNFT. **i do not recommend to hold your savings on a non Custodia Wallet**. To Save your Funds Transfer them to a Self Custody Wallet.
